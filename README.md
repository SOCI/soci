Brief History
-------------
Originally, SOCI was developed by [Maciej Sobczak](http://www.msobczak.com/)
at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch/) as abstraction layer for Oracle,
a **Simple Oracle Call Interface**.
Later, several database backends have been developed for SOCI,
thus the long name has lost its practicality.
Currently, if you like, SOCI may stand for **Simple Open (Database) Call Interface**
or something similar.

> "CERN is also a user of the SOCI library, which serves as a database access
> layer in some of the control system components."
