---
Version 2.2.0 differs from 2.1.0 in the following ways:

- Added true support for statement preparation with PostgreSQL.

- Added support for the stream-like extraction from Row.

- Added STL-compatible iterator interface for select statements.

- Refactored the set of common tests to validate core library functionality
  independently on the target database server.

- Introduced new backends for MS SQL Server (via ODBC) and Firebird.

- Provided complete build system for both Unix (autotools) and
  Windows (solution and project files for MSVC++).

---
Version 2.1.0 differs from 2.0.1 in the following ways:

- Added two additional backends: MySQL and SQLite3

- Restructured the source code layout so that the whole library was broken
  into the "core" part and independent "backends", each in its own
  directory together with appropriate tests.

- Provided basic Makefiles for static and shared libraries on
  Linux-compatible systems.

- Added the general class and function reference to the documentation.

---
Version 2.0.1 differs from 2.0.0 in the following ways:

- Corrected some typos in documentation.

- Corrected handling of dynamic rowset description for those backends
  which do not have dedicated description functionality.

  TypeConversion-based type.

---
Version 2.0.0 differs from 1.2.1 in the following ways:

- The whole library was internally re-architectured to allow operation
  with many different backends. The top-level part of the library
  (the syntax layer) provides essentially the same interface as in previous
  versions of the library, but it can work with independent (and dynamically
  selected) backends, possibly targeting different database engines.
  As a prove of concept (and to encourage developments of new backends),
  the PostgreSQL backend was provided in addition to the Oracle one.
  During this re-architecturing, some minor bugs were fixed as well.

- The old Boost-style license was changed to the new (v. 1.0) Boost license.

---
The version 1.2.1 differs from 1.2.0 in the following ways:

- A bug was fixed that caused compile errors on MS VC++ compiler.

---
The version 1.2.0 differs from 1.1.0 in the following ways:

- A memory leak when reading into Row objects was fixed.

- Bulk (array) operations were introduced for high-performance
  applications, where the number of network round-trips can be
  significantly reduced by operating on whole arrays (vectors).

---
The version 1.1.0 differs from 1.0.1 in the following ways:

- Explicit support for calling stored procedures was added.

- Dynamic row recognition (type discovery) was added.

- Support for user-defined data types was added.
