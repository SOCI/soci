# Conan package for SOCI

## Test the package creation
How to test the package from the current dir (`... soci/.conan/`):

    conan create . conan/stable

If the package creation was successful, it will also run
the example project (called `example`). 
The expected output of running the `example` is:

```
Hola SOCI
sqlite3_statement_backend::prepare: no such table: test1 while preparing "DROP TABLE test1".
id: 7
name: John
adi√≥s SOCI
```

## How to use it
This recipe is meant to be tested only locally, but 
once the recipe is added to [conan.io/center](https://conan.io/center/),
the way to include SOCI in a new project using `cmake` will
be the following:

1. Create a `conanfile.txt` using `sqlite3` as backend: 
    
    ```
    [requires]
    sqlite3/3.33.0
    soci/4.0.1
    
    [options]
    soci:cxx11   = True
    soci:sqlite3 = True
    soci:empty   = True
    
    [generators]
    cmake
    ```

2. Add the following lines to the `CMakeLists.txt`:

    ```
    include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
    conan_basic_setup(TARGETS)
    conan_target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${CONAN_LIBS})
    ```

    The command `conan_target_link_libraries()` will replace the `target_link_libraries()`, so
    if you have any other library to link you can add it here instead, and remove
    the `target_link_libraries()`  
    The `${PROJECT_NAME}` is the name of the target.

3. Run from your build directory.  
    `conan install <path_to>/conanfile.txt` 

4. Build your project.

## Notes:

- To install conan use `python > 3`: `pip3 install --user conan`  
- Conan version used: `1.31.4`
- Package tested on: `Ubuntu 18.04`, `gcc-7`
- Currently only supports these backends:
    - sqlite3
