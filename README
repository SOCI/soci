## Requirements

SOCI requires DB engines to be already installed.

If a DB engine has been installed through its official installer, then SOCI's
build system will find it automatically.

If instead you have installed a DB engine to a custom location, you have to
specify the root installation path at build time.

This applies to engines built with the algoB dev system as well. The example
below is for SQLite 3.

* First, clone, build and install the algoB version of SQLite 3. In the example
  below, we will install it to `$HOME/lib`.

```bash
$ cd ~/code
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:algoB/sqlite3.git
$ cd sqlite3/build
$ cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/lib
$ ninja
$ ninja install
```

* Then specify the SQLite 3 install path in your top-level CMake command:

```bash
$ cd ~/code
$ cd your_project/build
$ cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSQLITE_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/lib
```

SOCI's build system will look into `$HOME/lib` and will find our installed
files and targets.
